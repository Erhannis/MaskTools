Tools to help people sew masks for doctors etc. dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic.

Read the header in mask_tools.scad for printing instructions.  (The bare minimum: PRINT AT -0.08 HORIZONTAL EXPANSION, or probably nothing will fit together.  And/or, use the fast.curaprofile profile to print things fast.  Print all the files with "MAIN" in the name.  Of those, print two of the ones that say "print_two" in the name.)
